Thank you for helping us to improve the IOTA Documentation!

So that we can better assist you, please note the following:
- If you have a question about the functioning of any IOTA product, join the discussion on our [**IOTA Discord**](https://discordapp.com/invite/fNGZXvh). There, you can find channels like #documentation, #iri, #javascript, #mam and many others. We and the rest of the community will be happy to help!
- If you found a bug or would like to suggest an improvement for a particular IOTA product, we encourage you to create an issue in the respective repository. For example, IRI lives in the [IRI repository](https://github.com/iotaledger/iri) repository.
- If you found something wrong with the documentation, or would like to improve something, please provide the information here, or feel free to submit a pull request with your suggested changes. We will review your contributions and update our documentation accordingly. Please see our [**contribution guidelines**](CONTRIBUTING.MD) first.
